			<img src="http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_06_figo1.jpg"></center>
			<p> A golden retriever service dog named Figo was injured after he stepped into the path of a mini school bus in an apparent attempt to protect his 62-year-old blind owner Audrey Stone when they were walking in Brewster, NY. The manager of a convenience store said, "I don't know if [the bus driver] thought [Stone] was going to move faster, but it looks like the dog tried to take most of the hit for her." <a href="http://gothamist.com/2015/06/10/service_dog_earns_kibble.php" target="_blank">MORE</a>
